P Srinu at 10:24, Mar 12:
I see that certificate is issued and installed perfectly on hosting but the website is showing warning triangle instead of Green Pad lock is because of the Mixed Content.

The browser is hiding the Green link/Green Bar because there is mixed/insecure content in the HTML code of the page. The content of the page is the customer's responsibility.

It is simple that they have to make sure every part of the website is redirecting to https and secured.

P Srinu at 10:25, Mar 12:
The content of the page is the customer's responsibility. Site will shows secured once you resolve the mixed content.
